# SIMT C Cluster

`response FIFO` holds the packet ejected from ICNet before direction to SIMT C Inst Cache or memory pipeline(LDST unit).  
ICNet request can be made by each SIMT core by it's own `injection port`.  
But `injection port buffer is shared`.

## Fetch and Decode

1. Instruction Buffer
	- Statistically partitioned so that all warps running on SIMT core have dedicated storage to place inst.
	- 2 I-B entries / 1 warp
	- I-B entry :
		- 1 valid bit
		- 1 ready bit -> ready to be issued to execution pipeline.
			- simulator handles this during the schedule and issue stage using scoreboard logic and availability of hardware resources.
		- 1 decoded instruction
	- **Empty initially**
2. Warp
	- Can fetch if no instruction in I-B.
	- Eligible warps access the I-C in round robin order.
	- By default 2 consecutive inst. are fetched.
		- Valid bit in the I-B is activated for this warp only
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Until all fetched inst. are issued to the execution pipeline.</mark>
3. Inst. Cache
	- read-only
	- non-blocking set-associative cache
	- models both FIFO and LRU with no-miss or no-fill allocation policies.
	- In both cases of hit and miss the RR fetch scheduler moves to the next warp.
		- Hit : Decode
		- Miss : IC fetch request
	- warp will need to access the IC for collecting missing data
		- no access to IC while miss pending
4. _Kernel is considered done when all thread blocks are dispatched._
	- Thread block is considered done once all warps have finished all operations.
	- Warp is considered done once all warps if all its threads have finished without outstanding store or pending writes to local registers.
5. Decode
	- The recent inst. are decoded and stored in respective entry in the I-B.

> Each SIMT core has one SP unit and one SFU unit. Each unit has an independent issue port from the operand collector. Both units share the same output pipeline register that connects to a common writeback stage. There is a result bus allocator at the output of the operand collector to ensure that the units will never be stalled due to the shared writeback. Each instruction will need to allocate a cycle slot in the result bus before being issued to either unit. Notice that the memory pipeline has its own writeback stage and is not managed by this result bus allocator.
